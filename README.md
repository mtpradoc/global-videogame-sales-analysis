# Global Video Game Sales Analysis #

**Data Source**: Imported from a CSV file on Kaggle.

In this project, I analyzed global video game sales using Tableau. Key steps included:

1. **Data Exploration**:
    - Investigated dimensions and measures from the dataset, focusing on Global Sales as the primary metric.

3. **Visualization 1**: Global Sales Over Time by Genre
    - Added Global Sales to the rows and Year to the columns to visualize sales trends.
    - Used Genre as a color dimension, making it easy to distinguish between categories (e.g., sports games).
    - Applied filters to show sales for specific platforms (e.g., PlayStation 1-4).
    - Enhanced readability by labeling genres and adjusting font styles.

4. **Visualization 2**: Genre-wise Global Sales
    - Plotted Genre on the columns and Global Sales on the rows.
    - Sorted the genres and assigned distinct colors for clearer comparisons.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
    - Combined both visualizations into a cohesive dashboard.
    - Renamed worksheets for clarity and customized the layout for better user experience.
