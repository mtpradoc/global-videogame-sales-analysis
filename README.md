# Global Video Game Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global video game sales data, sourced from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) CSV file, using Tableau. The goal is to visualize sales trends over time, by genre, and by platform, providing insights into the performance of different video game categories and platforms.

## Project Details

### 1. Data Exploration
- Investigated dimensions and measures, focusing on `Global Sales` as the primary metric.
- Explored various attributes, including `Year`, `Genre`, and `Platform`, to build meaningful visualizations.

### 2. Visualization 1: Global Sales Over Time by Genre
- Added `Global Sales` to the rows and `Year` to the columns to show sales trends over time.
- Used `Genre` as a color dimension to easily distinguish between categories (e.g., sports games, action games).
- Applied filters to focus on specific platforms (e.g., PlayStation 1-4).
- Enhanced readability by labeling genres and adjusting the font styles.

### 3. Visualization 2: Genre-wise Global Sales
- Plotted `Genre` on the columns and `Global Sales` on the rows for a genre-by-genre comparison.
- Sorted the genres and applied distinct colors to improve clarity and differentiation.

### 4. Dashboard Creation
- Combined both visualizations into a cohesive dashboard for an interactive view of the sales data.
- Renamed and customized worksheets for improved clarity and user experience.

## How to Use
1. **Open Tableau Workbook**: Explore the Tableau workbook to interact with the visualizations.
2. **Apply Filters**: Use platform filters to narrow down sales data (e.g., focusing on PlayStation consoles).
3. **Explore the Dashboard**: Interact with the dashboard to view sales trends by year and genre, and compare the performance across platforms.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more granular filters for specific regions (e.g., North America, Europe).
- Expanding the dataset to include newer years of video game sales.
